STUBLE
========================================

Stuble is command line tool built with PHP to simplify working with stubs.
Stuble will collect parameters in your stub(s) file(s) and ask you those parameters.
So you don't need to write scripts to handle each stub file.

## REQUIREMENTS

* PHP >= 7.1
* Composer

## INSTALLATION


```
composer global require emsifa/stuble:dev-master
```

> Make sure you have register composer bin directory to your PATH variable. You can [read this](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#global) for more information.

## USAGE EXAMPLE

Before we get started, you need to know that stuble scan stubs files from 2 locations.

1. Local source: `stubs` directory wherever you want to use `stuble` command.
2. Global source: `stubs` directory inside `STUBLE_HOME` path.

If same stub file found in 2 sources, stuble will use local stub file.

#### Make Stub File

In your cmd/terminal, go to directory wherever you want to try stuble.

For example we are in `/home/me/coding/try-stuble`.

Then create file `stubs/model.stub` in that directory:

```php
<?php

namespace {? model_namespace["App\Models"] ?};

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

/**
 * Model {? entity ?}
 */
class {? entity.pascal ?} extends Model
{

    protected $table = "{? entity.snake.plural ?}";

}

```

#### Generate File From Stub

In that directory (in this example `/home/me/coding/try-stuble`), run command below:

```
stuble make model
```

Then stuble will scan needed parameters in our `stubs/model.stub`,
ask values for that parameters,
then ask again where to put result file.

Try example above, look at the result. You would realize things like:

* First word wrapped by `{?...?}` is a parameter that stuble would ask.
* Words wrapped by `["..."]` like `App\Models` is parameter default value.
* `pascal`, `snake`, `plural` are filters that modify your parameter value.
* You can use `.` to separate each filters (like `snake.plural`).

## THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

#### Using Global Source

If you want to use global source, you should define `STUBLE_HOME` in your environment variable.

For linux, you can add line below to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.

```
export STUBLE_HOME=/home/{your_username}/stuble
```

Then make `stubs` directory inside that path.

#### Generate Stubs in a Directory

Just put `path/to/directory` instead `path/to/filename` in `stuble make` command.
Stuble will collect parameters in stubs files inside that directory.
Then generate results files.

For example if your `stubs` directory has structure like this:

```
└── laravel-scaffolds
    ├── controller.stub
    ├── factory.stub
    ├── migration.stub
    ├── model.stub
    ├── resource.stub
    ├── store-request.stub
    └── update-request.stub
```

You can use `stuble make laravel-scaffolds` to generate `controller`, `factory`, `migration`, `model`, `resource`, `store-request`, and `update-request`.

#### Define Output File Path in Stub File

If you have your own standard filepath and don't want stuble ask for output filepath every `stuble make` that stub,
you can add line below at very top of your stub file:

```
===
path = "define/your/relative/path/here.ext"
===
```

Example:

```php
===
path = "app/Models/{? entity.pascal ?}.php"
===
<?php

namespace App\Models;

class {? entity.pascal ?} extends Model
{

    protected $table = "{? entity.snake.plural ?}";

}

```

Now if you create file from that stub, stuble won't ask you output filepath.
Instead stuble will automatically put file using that format.

#### Append to Existing File

You can also append existing file instead of creating new file each make stub file.

For example you want to append some code into laravel routes file:

```
===
[append]
file = "routes/web.php"
===
Route::resource('{? entity.kebab ?}', '{? entity.pascal ?}Controller');
```

Then whenever you make that stub file, `Route::resource(...)` will be appended to very bottom of `routes/web.php` file.

> You may realize now that code inside `===` and `===` is in TOML format. Actually, it can be YAML too :)

You can also append code in specific line, or after/before some code.

##### Append to specific line:

```
===
[append]
file = "routes/web.php"
line = 15
===
Route::resource('{? entity.kebab ?}', '{? entity.pascal ?}Controller');
```

Now whenever you make that stub file, `Route::resource(...)` will **always** appended to line 15 in `routes/web.php` file.

##### Append after specific code:

```
===
[append]
file = "routes/web.php"
after = "// Generated by Stuble"
===
Route::resource('{? entity.kebab ?}', '{? entity.pascal ?}Controller');
```

Now whenever you make that stub file, `Route::resource(...)` will **always** appended **after** line that contain "// Generated by Stuble".

##### Append before specific code:

```
===
[append]
file = "routes/web.php"
before = "// Code aboves was generated by Stuble"
===
Route::resource('{? entity.kebab ?}', '{? entity.pascal ?}Controller');
```

Now whenever you make that stub file, `Route::resource(...)` will **always** appended **before** line that contain "// Code aboves was generated by Stuble".

#### Built-in Filters

| **Filter**            | Description                              | Value                            | Result             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| **lower**             | Transform value to lower case.           | ProductCategory                  | productcategory    |
| **upper**             | Transform value to upper case.           | ProductCategory                  | PRODUCTCATEGORY    |
| **ucfirst**           | Make first letter capital.               | product category                 | Product category   |
| **ucwords**           | Make first letter in each words capital. | product category                 | Product Category   |
| **kebab**             | Transform value to kebab-case/dash-case. | ProductCategory                  | product-category   |
| **snake**             | Transform value to snake_case.           | ProductCategory                  | product_category   |
| **camel**             | Transform value to camelCase.            | product category                 | productCategory    |
| **pascal**            | Transform value to PascalCase.           | product category                 | ProductCategory    |
| **studly**            | Alias pascal.                            | product category                 | ProductCategory    |
| **title**             | Transform value to Title Case.           | product_category                 | Product Category   |
| **words**             | Transform value to words.                | product_category                 | product category   |
| **plural**            | Transform value to plural form.          | product_category                 | product_categories |
| **singular**          | Transform value to singular form.        | ProductCategories                | ProductCategory    |
| **replace(str, to)**  | Replace string in value.                 | "Foo\Bar\Baz".replace("\\", "/") | Foo/Bar/Baz        |


#### Make Your Own Filter

In this example we will add filter `substr`.

In your `stubs` directory, create file `stuble-init.php`.
Write code below:

```php
<?php

$stuble->filter('substr', function (string $value, int $start, int $length = null) {
    return substr($value, $start, $length);
});

```

Then you can use it like this.

```
// sample.stub

Your param: {? your_param ?}
Your param after substr: {? your_param.substr(0, 6) ?}

```

> You can use that filter in all stubs file inside that directory, including subdirectories too. If you have same filter in subdirectory, stuble will override it.

#### Show List Available Stubs

You can use command `stuble ls` to show list available stubs.

For example:

```bash
# Show list stubs in both global and local sources
stuble ls

# Show list stubs in global source only
stuble ls --global
# or
stuble ls -G

# Show list stubs in local source only
stuble ls --local
# or
stuble ls -L

# Show list stubs contains 'laravel'
stuble ls laravel

# Show list stubs contains 'laravel' in global source only
stuble ls laravel -G

```

#### Dump Result

If you want to dump result instead of save it, you can use `--dump` in `stuble make` command.

For example:

```
stuble make laravel-scaffolds --dump
```

#### Transform Existing File to Stubs Files (Experimental)

If you want to convert some of your files into stubs file, you can use `stublify` command.

For example you have `modules/users` directory that contain CRUD for users, you can convert it to stubs by running command:

```
stuble stublify modules/users my-module
```

This will convert files in `modules/users` directory to `.stub` files in `stubs/my-modules` directory.

After you run this command, stuble will ask you if you want to replace some texts with parameters.
Stuble also able to detect other formats of your text.
For example you want to replace "User" to `entity`.
Stuble will ask you if you want to replace
"Users" with `entity.plural`,
"users" with `entity.plural.lower`,
etc.
